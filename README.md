# Asteroid_GUI

More like the game engine for the full game Asteroids, not playable as a Game, but all functionality exists (with bugs). 
This version has the GUI frame for the full game, but nothing is displayed or playable. All gameplay is purely textual format.

Bugs: (Fixed in Graphical version)

1. Missile and PlayerShip location discrepancy
2. Move function incorrent
3. Tick function incorret
4. MapView not implemented corrently
5. Some interfaces not implemented correctly
